# Feed Forward Neural Network

This repository contains a python implementation of Feed Forward Neural Network with Backpropagation with Optimizers along with various parameters from scratch.This model is used to train the network to classify the images of Fashion MNIST Dataset.


# Usage

In BackPropagation_with_Optimzations.py, we have a class called BackPropagation. In this class we're initialising some variables with the help of constructor(__init__) of the class. So, whenever we create the object of the class the class will be initialised. Following are the parameters of the constructor:

1. input_size : An integer represents the number of features of input data.
2. output_size : An integer represents the number of output classes.(we're taking 1 as a default)
3. init_method : An string contains the name of the initialisation method.
